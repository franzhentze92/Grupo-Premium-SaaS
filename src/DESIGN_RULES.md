# Grupo Premium SaaS DESIGN RULES

**Strict rules for all UI development. Every new page/component must be checked against these before completion.**

1. **Primary Color:** Only use navy blue (`#1e3269`) for all primary UI highlights, headers, tabs, buttons, and icon backgrounds.
2. **Secondary Color:** Only use gold (`#fbbf24`) for secondary highlights, trends, and accents.
3. **No Green/Blue:** Never use green, default blue, or any other accent color for UI elements, except for status badges or KPI icons where clarity is needed.
4. **Executive Style:** All headers, KPI cards, tables, filters, and tabs must follow the dense, executive, information-rich style of the Informe Mensual and departmental pages.
5. **Table Headers:** Must be navy (`#1e3269`) with white text.
6. **Tabs:** Active tab must be navy with white text, flat and wide.
7. **Icons:** All icons must be navy or gold, never black or default, except for KPI cards (see below).
8. **KPI Cards:**
   - Must use a white card background.
   - Icon container (background) must be colorful (e.g., green, red, blue, purple, orange, etc.) and match the metric, as in Informe Mensual.
   - Icon itself should be colored for clarity (not navy/gold/black by default).
   - Value must be bold and dark, label and trend/secondary info clear and readable.
   - Layout must be compact, executive, and information-rich.
9. **Filters/Selects:** Must use navy/gold for icons and highlights.
10. **No Default Color Classes:** No green or default color classes anywhere except for status badges/KPI icons for clarity.
11. **Buttons/Icons on Navy:** Any button or icon on a navy background must use white or gold text/icons for contrastâ€”never dark text on navy.
12. **Consistency:** All new pages and components must be checked against this document before being considered complete.

**Reference:**
- Use the Informe Mensual and departmental Reporte Interno pages as the visual and structural reference for all new work.
- If in doubt, always choose navy/gold and executive density.
- For KPI cards, always use the colorful icon style as shown in Informe Mensual and the provided screenshot.
